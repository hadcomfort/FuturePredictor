# Project TODO List: The Synthetic Supper

This file outlines the next steps for improving The Synthetic Supper application.

## High Priority
1.  **Implement Real AI Story Generation:**
    -   In `backend/server.js`, replace the placeholder string with an actual API call to a large language model (LLM) like GPT-3, Claude, or a similar service.
    -   This is the core feature of the application and the highest priority.

2.  **Update `README.md` Documentation:**
    -   The `README.md` is slightly inaccurate. It states the frontend and backend are not connected, but they are.
    -   Update the "Project Status" section to accurately reflect that the connection is in place but the AI generation is a placeholder.

3.  **Create a `.env.example` File:**
    -   Add a `.env.example` file in the `backend` directory.
    -   It should list all the necessary environment variables, like `AI_API_KEY` and `PORT`, so other developers know what to configure.

## Medium Priority
4.  **Add Backend Testing:**
    -   Introduce a testing framework (like Jest or Mocha) for the backend.
    -   Write unit tests for the `/api/generate-story` endpoint to check for successful responses, error handling, and correct data processing.

5.  **Improve Frontend UI/UX:**
    -   Enhance the visual design of the frontend. This could include better typography, layout, and a more engaging color scheme.
    -   Improve the loading state to be more visually appealing than the current spinner.

6.  **Add "Copy to Clipboard" Functionality:**
    -   Add a button that allows users to easily copy the generated story text to their clipboard for sharing.

7.  **Refactor Backend into Modules:**
    -   Break down `backend/server.js` into smaller, more manageable modules.
    -   For example, create a separate service file for handling the interaction with the AI API.

## Low Priority
8.  **Add Specific Frontend Error Handling:**
    -   Currently, the frontend shows a generic error message.
    -   Improve this by displaying more specific error details returned from the backend API.

9.  **Implement a "Cancel Request" Button:**
    -   Add a button that appears during story generation, allowing the user to cancel the `fetch` request if it's taking too long.

10. **Add Frontend E2E Testing:**
    -   Use a framework like Cypress or Playwright to add end-to-end tests for the frontend.
    -   These tests would simulate user interaction to ensure the whole application flow works as expected.
