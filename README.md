# The Synthetic Supper

## A Speculative Fiction Story Generator

The Synthetic Supper is a web application that generates poignant "memory transcripts" from a speculative future. It allows users to create short, emotional stories that contrast authentic past experiences with a technologically mediated present.

## How to Use

1.  **Open `frontend/index.html` in your web browser.**
2.  **Fill out the form with the following parameters:**
    *   **Protagonist:** Describe the main character of the story (e.g., "an elderly woman in New Kyoto, 2092").
    *   **Past Experience:** Detail a memory from the protagonist's past (e.g., "eating a wild-foraged meal with her grandfather").
    *   **Present Reality:** Describe the protagonist's current reality (e.g., "consuming nutrient-optimized, 3D-printed food paste").
    *   **Catalyst Event:** The event that caused the shift from the past to the present (e.g., "The Great Spore Blight").
    *   **Narrative Format:** Choose the format of the story (e.g., "Memory Transcript", "Personal Diary Entry", "Audio Log").
3.  **Click "Generate Memory".**
4.  The generated story will appear below the form.
